# Decisions

This is an append-only log of choices that aren't obvious from the code.
Each entry has a date, the decision, why it was made, and what would
reopen it. Newest entries are at the bottom. To reverse a decision, add a
new entry that says so; don't edit the old one.

### D1: native OpenGL (glow + glutin), not wgpu (2026-10-08)

Scenes and Shadertoy shaders are GLSL. Native GL hands GLSL to the
driver's compiler, which is the model Synesthesia and Shadertoy (WebGL)
both use. wgpu ingests GLSL through naga, which rejects samplers passed
as function parameters, combined image/samplers, and some `const int`
switch patterns that real Shadertoy code uses (see PLAN.md §2 D1).

**Would reopen:** naga's GLSL frontend reaching parity, or macOS removing
OpenGL.

### D2: ANGLE as the fallback context, not native-only (2026-10-08, owner's choice)

The owner's `rustaman` app found that WGL fails on hybrid-graphics and
stale-driver laptops, which are exactly Strobe's target machines. ANGLE
translates GLES 3.0 to Direct3D 11, which is what Chrome uses to run
Shadertoy on Windows. glutin's EGL backend loads `libEGL.dll` on
Windows, so the ANGLE path is the same code as the Linux EGL path
pointed at ANGLE's DLLs. Native GL stays the first choice because it's
faster, and desktop GLSL is what SSF scenes are written in.

**Cost:** SSF scenes that rely on desktop-only GLSL (implicit
conversions) need source fixups on the ANGLE path. That's not built
yet; see OPEN_QUESTIONS.md.

### D3: GL 3.3 hardware floor (2026-10-08, owner's choice)

This means Intel HD 4000 / Ivy Bridge (2012) on Windows 10. Shadertoy
`#version 300 es` code is rewritten to `#version 330` when
`ARB_ES3_compatibility` is absent.

### D4: cargo workspace with rustaman's rules (2026-10-08, owner's choice)

Crates give fast incremental builds and hard boundaries (audio can't
touch GL). The lints, header banners, unsafe-leaf discipline, pinned
toolchain, cargo-deny, and LF line endings all come from
`lnorton89/rustaman`.

### D5: port rustaman's UI system (2026-10-08, owner's choice)

That means the themes.toml catalog with WCAG tests, motion durations,
the spacing scale, geometry icons, and the custom title bar. The default
theme is dark with a single amber accent. Not built yet.

### D6: `#version 330 core` on every desktop context (2026-10-08)

Real SSF scenes compare `PASSINDEX == 0.0` (int vs float) and write
`float x = 2;`. Desktop GLSL converts implicitly; GLSL ES doesn't.
Every 4.x core context, including macOS 4.1, accepts 330. One dialect
means one set of behaviours.

### D7: one program per pass, `PASSINDEX` a constant (2026-10-08)

A fragment program's register allocation, and therefore its occupancy,
is set by its heaviest path. If a cheap blur pass shares a program with
a raymarcher, the blur runs at the raymarcher's occupancy. Specialising
lets the driver delete untaken branches. The trade-off is N compiles
instead of one at load time, which is fine because playlists precompile.
`Options::specialise_passes = false` keeps the faithful mode, and the
bench measures both (`--shared`).

### D8: the final pass is implicit (2026-10-08, verified)

Verified against real community scenes: a scene listing two `PASSES`
renders `PASSINDEX` 0 and 1 into them, then `PASSINDEX == 2` produces
the output. `SceneDef::passes` always ends with that final, untargeted
pass.

### D9: frame-rate-independent smoothing (2026-10-08)

SSF documents smoothing as "about `1/PARAMS` frames", which is a
per-frame exponential step. Per-frame steps mean a scene tuned at 60 fps
feels twice as sluggish at 30 fps, which is exactly what happens on an
old laptop. We use `alpha = 1 - (1 - PARAMS)^(dt*60)`, which is
identical at 60 fps.

### D10: original benchmark scenes (2026-10-08)

The owner asked for 10 scenes spanning GPU load. Shadertoy is
unreachable from the cloud environment (Cloudflare 403 on every
request), and the community Synesthesia scenes found on GitHub carry no
license. So the base library in `scenes/` is original and MIT-licensed,
written to span five load tiers on purpose (see BENCHMARKS.md).
Unlicensed community scenes are used only as local, uncommitted
compatibility fixtures.

**Would reopen:** a source of permissively licensed SSF or Shadertoy
scenes, or the owner supplying their own scenes.

### D11: pass sizes as fractions of the design resolution (2026-10-08)

`"WIDTH": 960` in a 1920-wide scene is stored as `0.5` and multiplied by
the actual render width. That way render scale (the main lever on old
GPUs) shrinks every buffer in proportion instead of leaving 1080p
buffers behind a 720p output.

### D12: ANGLE comes from a pinned Electron release (2026-10-08)

ANGLE doesn't publish binaries, and building it needs Chromium's
`depot_tools` toolchain. Every official Electron `win32-x64` release ships
Google's ANGLE build (`libEGL.dll`, `libGLESv2.dll`) plus
`d3dcompiler_47.dll`, under BSD/MIT licenses with
`LICENSES.chromium.html`. `scripts/fetch-angle.ps1` downloads Electron
v38.2.0, checks the archive's SHA-256 against the release's
`SHASUMS256.txt`, checks each DLL's SHA-256, and copies them beside the
executables. To upgrade, bump the version and all four hashes in one
commit.

**Would reopen:** a need for ANGLE features newer than Electron ships, or
bundle size (about 13.5 MB for the three DLLs) becoming a problem.

### D20: the analyser has two clocks (2026-10-08)

Spectral analysis runs on audio time (one step per 512-sample hop), and
presentation runs on the caller's `dt`. A hop only writes *targets*
(normalised levels, hit peaks, beat events); `analyze(dt)` then glides,
decays and integrates toward them with `1 - exp(-dt/tau)`. Hits keep the
peak of every hop since the last call so a 20 fps render loop cannot miss
a kick. The result is the same frame-rate independence as D9, and the
analyser stays a pure function of (samples, dts), which is what makes
the WAV harness and the tests exact.

### D21: tempo by autocorrelation comb, with an octave prior (2026-10-08)

Peak-picking the autocorrelation lands on any harmonic of the beat. Each
candidate tempo (50 to 220 BPM, every 0.25) is instead scored by the
mean autocorrelation at its first four multiples, times a soft prior
centred on 120 BPM (one octave sigma). The biased autocorrelation also
favours the shorter period. A clean track resolves to the tapped tempo;
a track near the range edges can still report double or half time, which
tap tempo and nudge exist to override. Confidence is peak sharpness times
a stability term.

### D22: capture is one thread that owns the stream (2026-10-08)

cpal streams need not be `Send` on every backend, so the analysis thread
builds and keeps the stream, and handles device loss itself:
Running, Recovering, SilentFallback, retrying every 2 s. A missing device
is an `Err` from `Capture::start` and a silent, retrying handle from
`Capture::start_resilient`; the render thread only does an atomic pointer
load (`Capture::latest`). Windows loopback is cpal's behaviour of
building an input stream on a render device, so output devices are listed
(on Windows only) as `DeviceKind::Loopback`.

### D23: texture widths are a `Layout`, not constants (2026-10-08)

The real Synesthesia texture layout is unverified (OPEN_QUESTIONS Q10),
so `AudioFrame` carries `Vec`s sized by `Layout` (default 256 spectrum,
256 trail, 512x2 Shadertoy) and every texel is built from a bin span
computed from the layout. Changing a width changes data, not code.
