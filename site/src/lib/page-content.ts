/*
 * Per-route editable copy.
 *
 * Every route keeps its prose in a `content.md` beside its `page.tsx`, so
 * changing wording never means reading JSX. Next only treats `page`, `route`,
 * `layout` and friends as routable, so a `.md` sitting in the app directory is
 * inert.
 *
 * A page is rarely one continuous document — it has a lede, a couple of
 * section intros, a closing note — so the file is divided into named blocks:
 *
 *     <!-- @lede -->
 *     Markdown for the lede.
 *
 *     <!-- @closing -->
 *     Markdown for the closing section.
 *
 * Text before the first marker is the `body` block, which is all a
 * prose-only page needs.
 *
 * A block that carries a repeated thing — a highlight, a shipped capability —
 * is divided again by `###` headings, and `items` returns those as a list:
 *
 *     <!-- @highlights -->
 *
 *     ### No lifetime annotations
 *
 *     Borrow scopes are flow-sensitive and inferred by the compiler.
 *
 * Each item is keyed by the slug of its heading, which is what binds it to the
 * structure that stays in TypeScript — the icon it is drawn with, the anchor
 * it links to, the order it appears in. Rewording a heading therefore breaks
 * the build rather than silently pairing the wrong icon with the new title.
