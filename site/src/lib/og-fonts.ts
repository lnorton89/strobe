/*
 * Fonts for the social images.
 *
 * Satori needs real font bytes, which the browser-side `next/font` pipeline
 * does not expose. They come from @fontsource rather than from files committed
 * here: a vendored binary is one more thing to keep in step with the typefaces
 * the pages actually render, and Space Grotesk and Inter ship upstream mainly
 * as variable fonts, which Satori resolves to their default instance.
 * @fontsource publishes the static weights directly.
 *
 * .woff, not .woff2: Satori reads ttf, otf and woff, and @fontsource ships
 * both — so this picks the one that works rather than the smaller one, which
 * would fail at build time.
 *
 * The files are found by walking up from the working directory rather than
 * with `require.resolve`, because the bundler owns that function: pointed at a
 * .woff it fails the build with "Unknown module type", and pointed at the
 * package's package.json it returns an internal module id rather than a path.
 * Walking node_modules is invisible to it, and handles a dependency hoisted to
 * a workspace root as well as a local one.
