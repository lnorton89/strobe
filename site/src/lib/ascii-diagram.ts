/*
 * Recognising the diagrams the repository documents draw in text.
 *
 * docs/ARCHITECTURE.md draws the crate graph as an untagged fenced block of
 * box-drawing characters. Rendered as a terminal window it read as program
 * output, which is what it is not: it is a figure. These helpers let the
 * markdown renderer tell a figure from a transcript, and — when the figure is
 * a plain top-to-bottom flow — recover the labels so it can be drawn properly
 * instead of reproduced as text.
 *
 * Nothing here matches the current wording of any block. The tests decide from
 * the shape of the characters, so an upstream edit to a document changes
 * what the figure says without changing whether it is recognised. If the block
 * grows a branch, a legend or a second column, `parseFlow` declines and the
 * caller falls back to presenting the art as written; if it stops being a
 * diagram at all, `isAsciiDiagram` declines and it is an ordinary block again.
 * No path renders nothing.
