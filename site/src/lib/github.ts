/*
 * The repository's recent commits, read from GitHub's public REST API.
 *
 * Why this shape, given that the site is a static export with no server:
 *
 * - The list is fetched **at build time** and prerendered into the page. That
 *   is what makes the section correct with JavaScript off, with the API
 *   unreachable, and for a crawler. It is accurate at deploy and goes stale
 *   afterwards, which for a manually deployed site is a matter of days.
 * - The same list is fetched **again in the browser** on mount, and replaces
 *   the prerendered one when it arrives. That is the "live" half. A failure
 *   here is not an error state: the prerendered list simply stays.
 *
 * There is no Netlify Function in the middle. The unauthenticated limit is 60
 * requests per hour *per originating IP* (docs.github.com, "Rate limits for
 * the REST API"), so it is spent by the reader, one request per session per
 * TTL, and a normal visit spends one of sixty. A function would raise that to
 * 5,000/hour but only by introducing a token to store and rotate, a runtime
 * dependency where there is currently none, and a second thing that can be
 * down. The prerendered layer already covers the case the function would exist
 * to prevent.
 *
 * Everything here is a pure function over a payload except `fetchCommits`, so
 * tests/unit/github.test.ts can exercise the parsing, the caching and the
 * failure paths without a network.
