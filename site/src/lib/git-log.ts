 * The repository's own log, read at build time.
 *
 * The activity section used to be the last thirty commits and nothing else,
 * which for this repository was about two days: it lands roughly fifteen
 * commits on a day it moves at all, so a window measured in commits is a
 * window measured in hours. A window measured in days has to come from the
 * whole log, and the whole log is already here — the site is built from inside
 * the repository it describes, the same way the guide and roadmap pages are
 * rendered from docs/USER_GUIDE.md and docs/ROADMAP.md.
 *
 * Reading it here rather than from the API is not only cheaper, it is the only
 * way to get it at all: `/repos/{repo}/commits` pages at a hundred, so a
 * history of any length is several requests, and the reader's unauthenticated
 * budget is sixty an hour and belongs to them. The API refresh in lib/github.ts
 * still runs in the browser, but only to cover the commits that landed since
 * the deploy — which is one page however busy the week was.
 *
 * This module is imported by a server component only. `node:child_process` in
 * anything reachable from a client component would fail the build.
