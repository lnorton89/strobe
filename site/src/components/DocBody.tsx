 * The layout for a long repository document.
 *
 * These files run to hundreds of lines — the user guide and the roadmap are
 * both book-length by web standards — and as a single column they read as a
 * wall. A contents rail beside the prose turns the same text into something
 * navigable, and gives the reader a sense of how much is left.
 *
 * The rail only appears where there is room for it; below the large breakpoint
 * the document is a single column, since a sticky sidebar on a phone would
 * cost more space than it earns.
