/*
 * The recent-commit feed: a summary of the window, a filter across the areas
 * it touched, and the log itself.
 *
 * The list this renders first is the one the build baked into the HTML, so the
 * section is complete before any script runs and stays complete if none ever
 * does. On mount it looks for a fresh list — from sessionStorage first, then
 * from GitHub — and swaps it in silently.
 *
 * What this component never does, in any state:
 *
 * - show a spinner. There is already something correct on screen; a spinner
 *   over it would be a worse view of the same page.
 * - show an error. A failed fetch leaves the prerendered list exactly where it
 *   was, which is the right outcome and needs no announcement.
 * - change height. Every part of it is a fixed height that does not depend on
 *   how many commits, areas or days are in hand, so the moment fresh data
 *   lands nothing below it moves — and nothing inside it moves either.
 *
 * That last constraint is what decides most of the layout below. It is why the
 * log scrolls inside a frame rather than growing to fit thirty commits, why
 * the filter chips scroll sideways on one line rather than wrapping onto a
 * second, and why the rows clip their subject rather than wrapping it. A
 * commit message is arbitrary text and the number of areas a fortnight touches
 * is arbitrary too; a section whose height is a function of either cannot
 * reserve its space.
 *
 * Nothing here is computed from the current time. Every number and every date
 * on screen is a function of the commit list alone, so the server's render and
 * the browser's agree and there is no hydration mismatch to reconcile.
