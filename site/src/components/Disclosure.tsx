/*
 * A collapsible section.
 *
 * Built on <details>/<summary> rather than on a button and a piece of state,
 * for two reasons that both matter more than the styling freedom a custom
 * toggle would buy:
 *
 * - The content is in the DOM whether the section is open or not, so a crawler
 *   and a reader without JavaScript get the whole document. A JS toggle that
 *   unmounts its children hides them from both.
 * - The open/closed state, the keyboard handling (Enter and Space) and the
 *   announcement of "expanded"/"collapsed" are the browser's, not ours. Every
 *   hand-rolled version of this has to reimplement all three, and usually gets
 *   the announcement wrong.
 *
 * The marker is a plus turning into a minus, drawn from two straight strokes,
 * so the open state is said by the figure losing a line rather than by a
 * rotation.
