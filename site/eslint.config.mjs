   * Canonical Tailwind classes, enforced rather than suggested.
   *
   * An arbitrary value that a registered token already produces —
   * `bg-[color:var(--hairline-strong)]` for `bg-hairline-strong`,
   * `tracking-[-0.025em]` for `tracking-tight` — kept coming back: the editor
   * reported it, someone fixed it, and the next rewrite of the component
   * reintroduced it. A suggestion nobody's build reads is not a rule.
   *
   * `enforce-canonical-classes` is the plugin's implementation of Tailwind's
   * own canonical suggestions, which is the same mechanism the editor was
   * reporting from, so the two now agree. It resolves tokens from the theme by
   * reading globals.css, which means a token added there is covered without
   * this file changing.
   *
   * `collapse` is off. It rewrites four sides into a shorthand
   * (`mt-2 mr-2 mb-2 ml-2` into `m-2`), which is a different judgement from
   * "you spelled a token the long way" and would churn layout classes that are
   * written per side on purpose.
