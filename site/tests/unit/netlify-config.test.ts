 * generic download — which every social scraper rejects. netlify.toml restores
 * the type.
 *
 * This cannot be checked end-to-end: the Playwright run is served by `serve`,
 * which knows nothing about netlify.toml. The e2e suite therefore asserts the
 * bytes are a valid PNG, and this asserts the header rules that make the
 * deployed site serve them as one.
